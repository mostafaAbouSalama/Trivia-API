# Full Stack Trivia API Project

## Introduction

This project was created as part of Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree program in order to practice implementing API endpoints using development best practices. The goal was to complete the backend API for a trivia web app. The frontend was provided. The application:

1) Displays trivia questions (either all questions or those from a specific category). The category and difficulty rating are also displayed for each question. Users can choose to either show or hide the answer.
2) Provides the ability to add or delete questions.
3) Provides the ability to search for questions based on a text query string.
4) Includes a quiz game, presenting a random question from all questions or questions within a specific category. Previous questions are not presented again until the game ends.

Backend code follows PEP8 style guidelines.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

This project requires that you install Python 3, pip and npm software. It is recommended that to set up a virtual environment. Please see specific, additional requirements for both the backend and frontend below.

### Backend

The backend has been developed by the Flask/SQLAlchemy framework. All dependencies are listed in __requirements.txt__ in the backend directory. To install all required packages, cd into to the backend directory and run the following from the bash command line.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Database Setup

The project was developed using a Postgres database, thereby requiring the installation of this system if you do not already have it installed. A version of the underlying database can be restored by running the following from the command line in the backend directory:

```bash
createdb trivia
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

#### Starting the server

The server can be started by executing the following commands from the backend directory:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

### Frontend

This project requires that you install Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM), both of which can be downloaded together at [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

In order to use NPM to manage the frontend's software dependencies, run the following from the command line from the frontend directory:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Starting The Frontend in Development Mode

To start the app in development mode, type the following from the command line in the frontend directory:

```bash
npm start
```

### Tests

To run the tests included in test_flaskr.py, run the following from the command line in the backend directory:

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

Please note that the first line can be dropped the first time that the test is run.

## API Reference

### Base URL

In its present form, the app can only be run locally. The frontend is hosted locally at http://127.0.0.1:3000/, while the backend can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

### Authentication

The current version of the application does not require either authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects. The object below is an example of an error returned if the user tries to retrive a page of questions that does not exist:

```
{
  "error": 404,
  "message": "resource not found",
  "success": false
}
```

The API will return the following error types:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable

### Resource Endpoint Library
